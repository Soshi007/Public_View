C. Program RUNS with no known issues now, Ongshi and Lauryn took fast action to fix part 6 and 7, . Lauryn also updated class definition of person, name and id are now protected and getter function for id and name are now added.
the sort functions were working properly with the logic in place, slight object type fixes solved the compile issues that rose after ongshi fixed the insert function data node pointer** issue.
